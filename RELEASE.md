# Release Instructions

This document guides a contributor through creating a release of aiokef.

## Preflight checks

### Ensure all tests pass

Locally you can run `tox` to check that all tests pass, and check that tests
against all supported environments are passing also by checking aiokef's
[GitHub actions](https://github.com/basnijholt/aiokef/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3Atests).

## Make the release

Add a release on GitHub.
